FIRST, or For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology, is an organization founded by inventor Dean Kamen in 1989 in order to develop ways to inspire students in engineering and technology fields. The organization is the foundation for the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST LEGO League, Junior FIRST Lego League, and FIRST Tech Challenge competitions.

FIRST seeks to promote a philosophy of teamwork and collaboration among engineers and encourages competing teams to remain friendly, helping each other out when necessary. The term frequently applied to this ethos is "gracious professionalism," a term coined by Woodie Flowers which supports respect towards one's competitors and integrity in one's actions. As Dean Kamen is so fond of saying, FIRST is not about building robots. At every level of competition FIRST is about getting people involved in Engineering in a fun and interesting way.

FIRST started out with one program called the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). FRC is designed to inspire high school students to become engineers by giving them real world experience working with professional engineers to develop a robot. The inaugural FIRST Robotics Competition was held in 1992 in the Manchester Memorial High School gymnasium. As of 2015, over 3,000 high school teams totaling over 75,000+ students from around the globe are participating in the FIRST program.

The competition challenge changes each year and details about the new challenge is released on the first Saturday in January. The team is given six weeks to build a brand new robot and they are only permitted to reuse certain, specified components from previous years. The robots usually weigh around 120 lbs. The kit issued to each team contains a base set of parts to use to build the robot. Registration and the kit of parts together cost about US$6000. In addition to that, teams are allowed to spend another $3500 on their robot. The purpose of this rule is to lessen the influence of money on teams' competitiveness. 

In 2015, teams will participate in 56 regional competitions throughout March in an effort to qualify for the FIRST Championship located in St. Louis, Missouri in April. Previous years' Championships have been held in Atlanta, Georgia, and at Walt Disney World's Epcot. Each year, the FIRST Robotics Competition has scholarships for the participants in the program. In 2014, there was over $20 million worth of scholarships from 180+ colleges, universities, associations, and corporations. To find out more about FIRST visit www.usfirst.org
